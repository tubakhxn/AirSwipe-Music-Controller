## ⚙️ Quick Setup

1. **Create a virtual environment and install dependencies:**
   ```powershell
   python -m venv venv; .\venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

2. **Add your music:**
   - Create a folder named `local_music` in the project root.  
   - Add `.mp3`, `.wav`, or `.ogg` files there.

3. **(Optional) System Volume Control — Windows Only**
   - `pycaw` (included in `requirements.txt`) lets you control the **Windows master volume** directly.  
   - Run the script with:
     ```powershell
     python gesture_spotify_player.py --system-volume
     ```
   - If not specified, volume gestures only affect the internal `pygame` playback volume.

4. **Run the player:**
   ```powershell
   python gesture_spotify_player.py
   ```

## 💡 Notes & Tips
- 🖐️ Run locally for **real-time webcam access** and **low-latency control** (Colab isn’t ideal for live gesture input).  
- 🎯 If gestures trigger too easily, adjust thresholds in `gesture_spotify_player.py` (gesture buffer sizes, swipe distances, cooldowns).  
- 🔊 For full system-wide volume on Windows, ensure `pycaw` is installed and use the `--system-volume` flag.

## 🧠 Colab Note
A notebook version — `gestures_spotify_colab.ipynb` — is included for quick demos.  
> ⚠️ Webcam performance in Colab is limited (higher latency).  
> For the best experience, use **local execution**.
